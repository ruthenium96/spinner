# The answer of calculation:
#
# J: -229.863
# g: 1.98445
# RSS = 9.33523e-05#
#
# It should be mentioned, that Spinner and the article use different form of
# isotropic Hamiltonian, so J's from the article should be divided by two.
# Fit of chiT from the article: J = -230 K
# ESR data: g = 2.007, J = -240 K
